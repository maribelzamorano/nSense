/**
 * A round-based, hierarchy-enabled lookup coordinator. It proceeds in rounds,
 * that is, in each round, the lookup results are restricted to a common cluster
 * depth with the initiator. If one round does not return a sufficient result,
 * the next round relaxes the cluster depth restriction by one. Moving from one
 * round to another means that some contacts that have been queried in the first
 * round might be queried again; this is necessary as they might now return
 * additional contacts.
 * <p>
 * A second important point with this coordinator is that a lookup always
 * terminates the round that has currently been begun, even if the client does
 * not require the lookup to continue. This is because this coordinator is
 * mainly intended for bucket lookups, where the client only needs k contacts
 * with a certain prefix, but we want to finish the round so that the overlay
 * network gets more stable (by other peers seeing this contact).

	 * This coordinator proceeds in rounds, where each round restricts the

	 * in common with the node's own ID. If no satisfying result has been found
	 * in one round, this restriction is relaxed by one, that is in the next
	 * round, contacts from the next higher level in the cluster hierarchy may
	 * also be considered in this lookup. The last round has a depth of zero,
	 * that is all contacts are allowed. This way of proceeding guarantees that
	 * if a result can be found in a lower (more specialised) cluster, it will
	 * be returned by this lookup operation. It furthermore guarantees that this
	 * lookup returns no result if and only if no result can be found in the
	 * whole identifier space (that is, without any cluster restriction).
	 * <i>Please note that this guarantee only refers to the impact of cluster
	 * restriction. In general, there is always some probability that a key
	 * cannot be found with a lookup from certain nodes although it is present
	 * in the network.</i>

	 *            initiator. It should be a positive number bigger than or equal
