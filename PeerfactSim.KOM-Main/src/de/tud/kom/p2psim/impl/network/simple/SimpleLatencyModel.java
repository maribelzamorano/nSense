/**
 * This model is abstracting the details of the four lower OSI layers (UDP and
 * TCP) from the end-to-end connections between peers although important network
 * characteristics, like the geographical distance between peers, the processing
 * delay of intermediate systems, signal propagation, congestions,
 * retransmission and packet loss are incorporated into it. The message delay is
 * calculated using the following formula:
 * 
 * Message delay = f * (df + dist/v)
 * 
 * where dist - describes the geographical distance between the start and the
 * end point of the transmission, df - represents the processing delay of the
 * intermediate systems, v - stands for the speed of the signal propagation
 * through the transmission medium, and f - is a variable part which
 * encapsulates the retransmission, congestion.
