/**
 * Common interface for factories that is used to create components. Typically,
 * each layer implementation will have its own factory implementation. The
 * parameters of the component should be provided via <code>setXY</code>
 * methods. This way a concrete factory can be configured from config files. The
 * simulator's configurator will call <code>setFoo(value)</code> method for each
 * attribute or element <code>foo</code> found in the configuration file (inside
 * of the factory specification element).
 * <p>
 * Note: This is an instantiation of the <i>Abstract Factory</i> design pattern.
