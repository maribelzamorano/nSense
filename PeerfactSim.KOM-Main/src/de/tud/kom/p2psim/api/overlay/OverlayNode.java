 * The <code>OverlayNode</code> interface is the root interface of all specific

 * participant in the overlay. Note that one or more OverlayNodes may be hosted
 * by a single <NetID>. Participating OverlayNodes are assigned uniform random
 * <code>OverlayID</code>s from a large identifier space. Application-specific
 * objects (documents etc.) are assigned unique identifiers called
 * <code>OverlayKey</code>s, selected from the same identifier space.
 * OverlayNodes can perform several actions like joining, leaving or execute
 * particular operations depending whether the overlay is structured,
 * unstructured or hybrid.
