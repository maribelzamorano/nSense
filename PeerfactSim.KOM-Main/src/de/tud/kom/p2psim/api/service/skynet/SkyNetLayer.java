/**
 * This interface defines the methods, which the complete SkyNet-node can
 * execute. Since a SkyNet-node performs the tasks of a Coordinator and maybe
 * the tasks of a Support Peer, we divided the structure of a node into two
 * parts, from which one defines the functionality for the Coordinator (see
 * {@link SkyNetNodeInterface}), while the other defines the functionality for
 * the Support Peer (see {@link SupportPeer}). As both parts need a base to be
 * built on, this interface, from which <code>SkyNetNodeInterface</code> and
 * <code>SupportPeer</code> extend, provides the requested foundation.
